Great value, high quality.",5.0,"My cats love this food. The bag is light enough I can handle it easily. The cat food is nutritious and I like that the food nuggets are multi- colored rather than mono-colored. I will definitely buy again.

happy cats = happy life",5.0,"My kitties love this food. Fortunately. seeing as they're very picky. It's also affordable which is always a blessing right now with inflation. It seems to be flavorable and mixes well with other treats and food that I have for them. Sidenote: I have a new baby kitten, barely a month old, and to ween him off the nip, we mixed this water and friskies broth to help it soften up. It worked out amazingly!!! Buy this for your fur friends. You won't regret.

perfection in a cat food bag",5.0,"I needed something cheap to feed outdoor cats that have been coming by lately.  This is the cheapest quality cat food I could find on Amazon.  The strays and other outdoor cats love it.  I can't comment on the flavor but if these cats could talk they'd surely say it's great.
